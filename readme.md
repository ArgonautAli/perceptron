# Perceptron 

## p0: A single perceptron 

TODO: 
[ ] Describe a simple perceptron 
[ ] What is an input and output 
[ ] What are weights and weighted input 
[ ] Activation function 
[ ] Learning rate 
[ ] Feed forward, backpropagation, adjusting weights 

### Limitations of a single perceptron: 
- Can only solve problems that are linearly separable
- Like AND & OR 
- Cant solve XOR (exclusive OR)

## p1: Multilayered perceptron 

### Layers of XOR multilayer p-tron
Input layer ---- !AND ----| 
            |             AND---- 
            |___ OR ------|
